E.g. New file we add on our local and on Github or ADO repo that file is not there then its  
status is 'untracked'.

If anyfile on our local is modified and not on Github then its status is 'modified'.

The file that is added but not yet commited then its status is 'staged'.

The file that has no change on local and it is same as on github th3en its status is 'unchanged'.
